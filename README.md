# Algorithms and Data Structures
Code from this repository is not production ready, 
this is a repository where I will push from time to time code related to Algorithms or
Data Structures.
Algorithms that are implemented does not cover all possible cases, mostly they are the
simple working implementation, I may take care about their running time but did not take care
to cover edge cases.
